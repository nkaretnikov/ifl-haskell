This repository contains a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) version of the
code from ["Implementing Functional Languages: a
tutorial"](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/pj-lester-book)
by Simon L Peyton Jones and David R Lester as well as solutions to the
exercises.

Note that this implementation may differ from the one presented in the book.
